# AutoML Cashflow Optimization for Insurance Company üöÄ

This project aims to optimize the prediction of insurance charges using automated machine learning (AutoML). By evaluating multiple machine learning models, this project identifies the most effective algorithms for predicting insurance charges based on customer demographics and regional data.

## Project Overview üìä

The project utilizes a variety of machine learning models to predict insurance charges. The models are rigorously evaluated based on several performance metrics, including R2 Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The analysis includes visual representations of model performance and comparisons between predicted and actual values on both training and test datasets.

### Key Features

- **Model Evaluation and Selection**: 
  - The project evaluates a wide range of models, including Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Lasso Regression, and others. 
  - Models are compared using key metrics like R2 score, MAE, and MSE to identify the top performers.

- **Performance Visualization**:
  - Detailed charts and graphs provide a visual comparison of the predicted versus actual charges across different models.
  - Performance analysis is broken down by demographic variables such as age and region, offering insights into how different models perform across different customer segments.

## Model Performance Summary üîç

In the model comparison, Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with the following metrics:
